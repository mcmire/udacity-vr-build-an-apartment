# Build an Apartment Project

This project was developed for [Udacity][udacity]'s [VR Developer Nanodegree
course][vr-course]. The requirements were to create an apartment scene by
placing models (prefabs) into the scene, adding and configuring lighting
optimized for mobile, and attaching an animation to the globe that is triggered
when the screen is interacted with.
